# Roblox Free Item Buyer

Originally made by [insaneinthamembrane](https://github.com/insaneinthamembrane/roblox-free-item-buyer)


## What is this?
This is a script that will buy "all" the free items on the Roblox catalog.
There are some free items which need some requirements to be met before you can buy them, this script will not buy those items.

It uses a sqlite database to keep track of which items have been bought, so it will not buy the same item twice. Feel free to map the database to a specific location on your host machine if you want to keep the database after the docker pvc is deleted.
